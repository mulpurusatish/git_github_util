### Create a new BRANCH ###

Plannig to add new FEATURE, but worried about the consequences. This is where GIT BRANCHES come in. 

Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. Once you're done with the feature / page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the master branch.

mulpu@satishvm MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Tools/Git_workspace/github/projects/git_commands (master)
$ git branch
* master

Checkout option will be used to create new BRANCH n switched to the new BRANCH with the MASTER branch code, here.

mulpu@satishvm MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Tools/Git_workspace/github/projects/git_commands (master)
$ git checkout -b branch1                                                                                               
Switched to a new branch 'branch1'

mulpu@satishvm MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Tools/Git_workspace/github/projects/git_commands (branch1)
$ git branch
* branch1
  master
  
Now we can have the changes in the respective branches only.. until MERGE happens.
